## Project Description
This project aims to help people on interviews, helping them to say a salary range.

## Hypotheses / Questions
* Affects the salary depending on the state?
* Affects the salary the company industry?
* Can We predict the salary based on job title, geography and required skills?


## Dataset
* For this project, I scraped GlassDoor website because in EEUU they have in some offers a salary range estimation and I'm going to work with this estimation to make my own.
* The script is in the folder scripts/glassdoor.py

## Cleaning
*	Parsed numeric data out of salary 
*	Removed rows without salary 
*	Made columns for employer provided salary and hourly wages 
*	Made columns for if different skills were listed in the job description:
    * Python  
    * R  
    * Excel  
    * AWS  
    * Spark 
    * SQL
    * Tableau
*	Parsed rating out of company text 
*	Made a new column for company state 
*	Added a column for if the job was at the companyâ€™s headquarters 
*	Transformed founded date into age of company 
*	Column for simplified job title and Seniority 
*	Column for description length 


## Analysis
* Overview the general steps you went through to analyze your data in order to test your hypothesis.
* Document each step of your data exploration and analysis.
* Include charts to demonstrate the effect of your work.
* If you used Machine Learning in your final project, describe your feature selection process.

## Model Training and Evaluation
*Include this section only if you chose to include ML in your project.*
* Describe how you trained your model, the results you obtained, and how you evaluated those results.

## Conclusion
* Summarize your results. What do they mean?
* What can you say about your hypotheses?
* Interpret your findings in terms of the questions you try to answer.

## Future Work
Address any questions you were unable to answer, or any next steps or future extensions to your project.

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What were the steps?
How did you test the accuracy of your analysis and/or machine learning algorithm?

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a trello or kanban board?

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
